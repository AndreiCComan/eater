### NOTE: These are only some images of the project we built during the Web Programming course.
Due to the Servlets, JSPs and Apache I was unable to find a free and satisfying host on which I could load the entire project.
<br/>If anyone is interested I'll be glad to talk about it in more detail

## Project Description
### Home page
A large search bar is all you need in order to find a specific restaurant.
<br/>
You can search a restaurant using a combination of:
  * Name
  * Cuisine type
  * City
  * Country

You can login or register to the website.

### Restaurants result
Here you can see the results based on what you typed in the search bar.
<br/>
Restaurants are represented by a simple card that shows you:
  * Number of reviews
  * Rating(stars)
  * Small description
  
On top of the page there are some tools that can help you to filter the results based on your preferences.

### Restaurant profile
After you select a restaurant you can visit its profile.
<br/>
As a registered user you can:
 * Review the restaurant
 * Like/Dislike other comments
 * Upload a photo
 * Claim the restaurant
